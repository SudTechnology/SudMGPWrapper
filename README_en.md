## SudMGPWrapper

SudMGPWrapper is a wrapper based on the SudMGP SDK designed to simplify interaction with the SDK. Users can choose between the standard version SDK, which supports more games, or the Lite version SDK, which only supports certain games. For detailed information on supported games, please refer to the [detailed game support list](https://docs.sud.tech/en-US/app/Client/StartUp.html).

To install via CocoaPods, add the following dependencies to your  `Podfile`  according to the version you wish to use:

For the standard version of the SudMGP SDK:
```ruby
pod 'SudMGPWrapper', '~> 1.3.7'
```
For the Lite version of the SudMGP SDK:
```ruby
pod 'SudMGPWrapper_Lite', '~> 1.3.7'
